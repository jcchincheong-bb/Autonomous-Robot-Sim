# Autonomous Robot Simulations
Very basic simulation and animation of an autonomous robot.

Done as practice using the [mathwoorks Simulink guide](https://de.mathworks.com/help/simulink/gs/system-definition-and-layout.html). 

Simulations are quite rudamentary, but very educational.

## ðŸ”§ Current Features
- Simulation of robot obstacle alarm
- Simulation of robot moving between two coordinates
- 3D Animation of robot

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or later
- MATLAB Simulink

## ðŸš§ Future Work
- Better Path controller w/ obstacle detection
- Obstacle avoidance or emergency stop
